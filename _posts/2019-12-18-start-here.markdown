This is a website dedicated to my work, and anything else I find interesting. It is built using jekyll, a ruby-based static site generator. The link for this is below.

Much of this site is covers mycology, the study of fungi. In this case it focusses mostly on mushrooms, which are more interesting than microscopic and non-<i>basidiomycetes</i> fungi (sorry).
